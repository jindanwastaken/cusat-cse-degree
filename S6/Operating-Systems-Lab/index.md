Q : Generating the Fibonacci using Shell Script

A : [Fibonacci](./cycle2/fibonacci.sh)

Q : Checking for palindrome using Shell Script

A : [Palindrome](./cycle2/palindrome.sh)

Q : Finding the sum of N numbers using Shell Script

A : [Sum of N numbers](./cycle2/sumN.sh)

## Cycle 3

Q : Sending N numbers from a parent process to a child process and display the even numbers
and odd numbers separately

A : [Even Odd](./cycle3/evenOdd.py)

Q : Sending a 'string' from a parent process to a child process and child returns back whether it
is palindrome or not

A : [Palindrome](./cycle3/palindrome.py)

Q : Sending a list of numbers from parent process to child process and the child process sends
back all prime numbers from the list to the parent process.

A : [Prime](./cycle3/prime.py)

Q : Sending 'n' numbers from a parent process to a child process. Calculate the sum and average
of 'n' numbers and display it in the child process

A : [Sum and Average](./cycle3/sumAvg.py)

## Internal Exams

Q : Write a script to check whether the given number is prime or not \
Q : A parent process accepts n numbers from the keyboard and sends it to a child
process. The child process displays all prime numbers. Implement this using Pipes.

A1 : [Bash Prime](./internal/prime.sh) \
A2 : [Python Prime](./internal/prime.py)

## External Exams

Q : Write a shell script to find the largest and second largest number in a given list of numbers. \
Q : A parent process accepts a list of numbers from the keyboard and sends it to the child process. The child process then prints the largest and second largest number in the list. Implement this using
pipes

A1 : [Bash 1n2](./external/1n2Largest.sh) \
A2 : [Python 1n2](./external/1n2Largest.py)
